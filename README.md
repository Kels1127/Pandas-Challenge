Module 4 Homework

In summary, I concluded that the top performing schools, bottom performing schools, and passing rates by school type...students have a much higher passing rate in charter schools (~95%) than in district schools (~74%).

Looking at the summary of performance by spending ranges per student, it seems that students have a higher passing rate in the lower spending ranges (<$615).

As a whole, smaller and medium sized schools dramatically out-performed large sized schools on passing math performances (89-91% passing vs 67%).

Due to my increased personal workload last week, I was unable to schedule a tutoring session so I rewatched Module 4 class vidoes and reviewed in-class assignments in order to comprise my code for this project.
